A bug report/issue report should contain:

1) GodsEye version
2) Server Version+Fork
3) Client Version+Fork
4) ProtocolLib version
5) Console errors if there are any (using pastebin.com)
6) We recommend sending a video/screenshot of the issue if possible, so we would be able to fix it faster.
7) A very detailed description of the issue
